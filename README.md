# LeetCode Grind 

Hi, my name is Mohammed Sarhat. My goal with this directory is to track my growth during my LeetCode journey, and to document my thought process behind solving problems. 

I have decided to, for the sake of structure, follow the [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) pathway.

Some problems will have multiple solutions; for instance, Contains Duplicates could have two solutions; one Python-based solution, and one C++ solution. The thought process remains the same for either-or.
